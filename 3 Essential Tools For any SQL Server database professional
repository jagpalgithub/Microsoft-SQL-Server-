      3 Essential Tools For The SQL Server administration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have provided set up files for each application of three applications on my Github.
As someone deeply involved in SQL Server development, I rely on a few essential tools that make my work smoother. While SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
is fantastic for everyday tasks, there are times when I need to do more than just write queries and manage server objects. Here are my top three go-to tools
for working with SQL Server:

WinMerge - For Spotting Differences: Link: https://winmerge.org/downloads/?lang=en
Often, I need to compare the content of two stored procedures or table definitions to find disparities. To make this task easier, I turn to WinMerge,
a third-party open-source tool. It's straightforward and highlights where text in two files differs. While it offers advanced merging functions, I typically use
it to identify distinctions between pieces of text.

OnTopReplica - Maximizing Screen Space: Link: https://en.vessoft.com/software/windows/download/ontopreplica
Screen real estate can be limited, especially when working on a single display or a lower-resolution projector. OnTopReplica comes to the rescue by allowing you
to keep a selected window on top of all others. This is incredibly helpful when I need to reference some code or text while working in another window. It even lets
you crop and resize the window, showing only what's relevant. Plus, it's live, making it perfect for magnifying SSMS result sets during presentations.

ScreenToGif - Animated Explanations: Link: https://www.screentogif.com/
Sometimes, explaining concepts with pictures isn't enough. An animated touch can be far more effective. ScreenToGif is an open-source screen capture tool that excels
at turning recorded videos into GIF animations. It also offers the flexibility to edit individual frames, allowing you to add text, graphics, and even keyboard shortcuts
for clearer explanations.

In the world of SQL Server development, these three tools are my trusty companions. They simplify the process of spotting differences, maximize screen space, and enhance
explanations with animated GIFs. Incorporating them into your workflow can make your SQL Server development tasks more efficient and visually engaging.
